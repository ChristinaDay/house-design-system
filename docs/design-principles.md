# House Design System - Design Principles

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Personal Expression**: This system reflects our unique aesthetic as a couple
- **Iterative Refinement**: Built for continuous evolution and experimentation  
- **Technical Excellence**: Clean architecture that scales with our vision
- **Consistency**: Cohesive experience across all touchpoints

---

## üé® Visual Language

### Color Philosophy
**Brand Identity**: Purple (#6D5EF3) as our primary brand color
- Sophisticated yet approachable
- Modern with a timeless quality
- Distinctive without being overwhelming

**Supporting Palette**:
- **Accent Orange**: Warm contrast for highlights and CTAs
- **Neutral Grays**: Extensive scale for subtle hierarchy
- **Semantic Colors**: Clear success/warning/danger communication

### Typography Approach
**Font Strategy**: Inter family for clarity and versatility
- **Inter**: Primary UI text, clean and readable
- **Inter Display**: Headlines and hero content
- **JetBrains Mono**: Code and technical content

**Hierarchy**: Deliberately crafted scale from 12px to 60px
- Each size serves a specific purpose
- Consistent vertical rhythm
- Optimal readability at all sizes

## üèóÔ∏è Spatial System

### Spacing Philosophy
**8pt Grid Foundation**: All spacing based on 4px increments
- Predictable and mathematical
- Easy to implement in both design and code
- Creates natural rhythm and alignment

**Scale Strategy**: From micro (1px) to macro (384px)
- Covers component internals to page layout
- Consistent proportional relationships
- Flexible for various content needs

### Border Radius System
**Progressive Rounding**: From sharp to fully rounded
- `none` to `3xl` for variety
- `full` for pills and avatars
- Consistent corner treatments

## ‚ú® Interactive Design

### Shadow Strategy
**Depth Communication**: Subtle to dramatic elevation
- Physical metaphors for UI hierarchy
- Consistent light source (top-left)
- Performance-optimized implementations

### Transition Philosophy
**Purposeful Motion**: Every animation serves user understanding
- **Fast (150ms)**: Micro-interactions and hovers
- **Base (200ms)**: Standard state changes
- **Slow (300ms)**: Complex transitions
- **Slower (500ms)**: Page/view changes

## üéõÔ∏è Component Strategy

### Design Principles
1. **Token-Driven**: All styling flows from design tokens
2. **Variant-Based**: Clear prop APIs for customization
3. **Accessible by Default**: WCAG compliance built-in
4. **Composable**: Components work together harmoniously

### Naming Convention
- **Descriptive**: Names explain purpose, not appearance
- **Scalable**: Room for evolution and new variants
- **Consistent**: Predictable patterns across components

---

## üîÑ Evolution Strategy

### Iteration Framework
1. **Experiment**: Test ideas in the token playground
2. **Validate**: Use real components to verify changes
3. **Document**: Capture decisions and reasoning
4. **Implement**: Roll out systematically across platform

### Version Control
- **Semantic Versioning**: Clear impact communication
- **Breaking Changes**: Thoughtful deprecation process
- **Migration Guides**: Support for system updates

## üé® Current Design Decisions

### Color Palette Rationale
- **Brand Purple**: Chosen for its balance of creativity and professionalism
- **Orange Accent**: Complements purple, adds energy and warmth
- **Extended Neutral Scale**: Provides nuanced hierarchy options
- **Semantic Colors**: Standard expectations for user clarity

### Typography Choices
- **Inter Selection**: Modern, readable, and versatile
- **Weight Range**: Light to extra-bold for complete expression
- **Size Scale**: Mathematical progression for natural hierarchy

### Spacing Decisions
- **4px Base Unit**: Aligns with common screen densities
- **Comprehensive Scale**: Covers micro to macro spatial needs
- **Named Values**: Semantic naming over numeric for clarity

## üìã Design Checklist

### Before Adding New Tokens
- [ ] Does it serve a clear purpose?
- [ ] Is it consistent with existing patterns?
- [ ] Can it be achieved with current tokens?
- [ ] Will it be used across multiple components?

### Before Adding New Components
- [ ] Does it follow our design principles?
- [ ] Is it built with existing tokens?
- [ ] Does it have clear prop variants?
- [ ] Is it accessible by default?

### Before Making Changes
- [ ] Test in the playground first
- [ ] Consider impact on existing components
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Communicate changes to stakeholders
